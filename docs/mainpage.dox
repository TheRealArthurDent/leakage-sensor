/**
\mainpage 
A tiny sample project that makes your ESP8266 a client of an MQTT broker via
WiFi connection.

On startup your board will try to connect to the specified WiFi network and
will blink the built in ESP LED (GPIO 2) at 2 revolution per second while
doing so. Once successfully connected the node LED (GPIO 16) will blink
at 1 revolution per 5 seconds. If started with "#define DEBUG" it will log
the progress via the Serial port.
